# library
A TOP project

by [Andy](https://github.com/nerminDonlag)

This library can:
- add a book to the library
- remove a book from the library
- change read/unread status
- toggle page theme

Improvement ideas:
- improve user input verification (now it's just a alert message defined in script.js)
